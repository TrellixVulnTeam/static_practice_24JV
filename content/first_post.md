Summary: This is the first post on this new blog.  It's a practice vlog to make sure I know how to set up static sites with a custom theme.

##The First Post

This blog is an attempt to get a better understanding of Pelican and setting up static sites with a custom theme.  I'm hoping I don't run into too many road blocks, but I guess it's a good thing if I do.

I don't intend for anyone to actually find this, but if you do *I guess that's pretty cool* or something.

###Well, that's it for now

I hope you're having a wonderful weekend.


Peace!
